- input requirements: 
    - **h_words_hidden_states = bert_out[0]**: is hidden vector of all words of current sentence and local context, arround sentences (2 context sentences befor + 2 next sentences) 
    - **cur_sentence_indexes_masked:**:  is a masked of the words is in current sentence
      - for example: [False, False, True, True, True, False, False, False, False] => current sentence contains words: 2 3 4, and other words (words 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8) is the context 
- output:
  - sentence_vectors: is the average of word vectors in curent sentence, for example: = 1/3 * (w2 + w3 + w4)
  
- Use masked to compute the `sum`, and device to the `number of words` of curent sentence:

    ```python
    # compute sum of word hidden vectors, like in the example (w2 + w3 + w4)
    h_sum = torch.sum(h_words_hidden_states*cur_sentence_indexes_masked.unsqueeze(-1), dim=1)

    # compute the number of word in current sentences (e.g., total 3 words in the exmaple) - and compute the reverse of length (e.g., 1/3)
    h_reverse_number_of_words = 1 / torch.sum(cur_sentence_indexes_masked, dim=1)
    
    # compute sentence_vectors by the average of word vectors in curent sentence
    sentence_vectors = h_sum*h_reverse_number_of_words.unsqueeze(-1)
    ```

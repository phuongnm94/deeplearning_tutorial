- given this data input containing many conversations like this:  
  ![img](../../img/masked.png)
- requirements: construct the masked tensor to save the utterances speaker information. 
- output requirements: 
    - **intra_speaker_masekd**: a 2 dimmentions tensor (or list of list) A, wherer `Aij == True` if `speaker(u_i) == speaker(u_j)` => shape = (n_conversation, len_longest_conversation, len_longest_conversation)
    - **inter_speaker_masked**: a 2 dimmentions tensor (or list of list) A, wherer `Aij == True` if `speaker(u_i) != speaker(u_j)`  => shape = (n_conversation, len_longest_conversation, len_longest_conversation)
- tips:  
  - create a 2 dimmensions list (list in list by using 2 for loop). Remember that the information of speaker is saved in the `sample['genders']` where sample is a conversation which is one element of batch.  The same genders is the same speaker. 
  - `inter_speaker_masked` is unnecessary because just use simple way to create: `inter_speaker_masked = ~intra_speaker_masekd` to revert flag `true` to `false`
